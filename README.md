# Speedclimbing timer
## A timing utility for speed climbing

Using both a microcontroller and a front end computer, this project can be used to accurately measure and display the time needed to top the speed climbing wall.


## Features
- IFSC rule compliant
- precise timing
- automatic communication between the Arduino and the front end

## Hardware requirements
- Microcontroller compatible with the Arduino IDE (recommendation: NodeMCU)
- Computer running Python (recommendation: Raspberry Pi Zero W)
